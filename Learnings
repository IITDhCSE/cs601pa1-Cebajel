How to include the include folder and lib folder on a server?
include folder contains .h files and lib contains .a files.

2*1024*1024*1024 = 2147483648
But in int the max +ve representable in c++ is 2147483647
Hence it would give -2147483648 thus giving you negative throughput.

By doing this:
2 * ((n*n*n) / elapsedtime1.count())
The expression was type casted to double thus staying +ve and giving correct answer.
